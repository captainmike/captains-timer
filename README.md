captains-timer.js
==============

JavaScript timer countdown behaviour that is UI and library agnostic.

captains-timer.js could be easily integrated with UI to create for eg. a session countdown dialogue.

By default, it makes use of cookies.js from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.cookie to allow timer to be extended across multiple tabs. this could be replaced with local storage for example to achieve the same effect.
